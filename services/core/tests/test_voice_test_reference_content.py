"""Grounded reference-question generation for a Voice Test - split across
two things tested separately:

1. create_test schedules the generation as a FastAPI background task
   (via BackgroundTasks.add_task) rather than awaiting it inline - a real
   kg call reliably takes 10-25s, which previously made "Create" itself
   take that long and blow past nool-apps' 10s client request timeout
   (apiClient.ts's REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS), so the app showed test creation as
   failed/timed out even though Core eventually succeeded. Verified here
   with a fake BackgroundTasks that just records what was scheduled,
   proving create_test returns without ever calling kg_client itself.

2. _generate_reference_content (the generation logic the background task
   ultimately runs) - kg_client.generate_assessor_content is monkeypatched
   here (a real call was already verified by hand against a running kg +
   Neo4j); this only tests Core's own wiring: chapters without a KG
   order_index are skipped, a successful call writes
   reference_questions/textbook_context, and a failed call doesn't raise.

Real rows against the dev Postgres via db_session, same pattern as
test_voice_test.py.
