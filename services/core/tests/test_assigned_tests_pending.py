"""GET /me/assigned-tests and GET /me/dashboard's pending_tests - before
this fix, both queries filtered only on class-membership
(VoiceTestTargetStudent), never on the student's own completion, so a
Test the student already finished never left their "current"/pending
list. This was a second, independent cause behind "once test is done,
not going to next page" alongside the fixed Homework auto-generation.
