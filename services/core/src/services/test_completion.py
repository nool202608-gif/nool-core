"""Writes the real outcome of a completed AI Assessor session tied to a
VoiceTest - the missing link flagged in NEXT_STEP.md: before this, nothing
in the codebase ever transitioned a VoiceTest to COMPLETED/RESULTS_READY or
wrote StudentTestResult/StudentTestResultBloomScore/StudentPoints, so
school_analytics.py's mastery/Bloom/trend numbers and the leaderboard read
as if no test had ever happened, and homework.py's `test.status ==
RESULTS_READY` gate made "generate follow-up Homework from test gaps"
unreachable in production - only ever exercised via hand-seeded test
fixtures.

On top of that, also fans out to homework_autogen.auto_generate_homework -
per product direction, a student's own completed session is their
"learning path," and Homework is the automatic next step on it rather than
something that waits on a teacher noticing the result and running the
manual generate/review/assign flow (homework.py still has that flow,
unchanged, for whole-class intervention).

Also upserts StudentChapterProgress for the Test's chapter - the "Journey"
chapter map (src/api/routes/journey.py) reads that table to decide which
chapters are DONE/CURRENT/LOCKED, and before this fix nothing anywhere
ever wrote to it, so no chapter could ever advance past the first no
matter how many Tests a student completed. Stars are computed via
stars.py's shared threshold function - the same one nool-apps'
computeSessionReward.ts uses client-side for the win screen's star
reveal, so the number the student sees there matches what Journey stores.

`mastery_percent` is a completion-rate placeholder (percent of questions
answered), an honesty-first formula given no LLM/grading vendor exists yet
(see content_generator.py's docstring) - not a real correctness grade.
Points awarded follow the same principle: 10 points per question actually
answered, a real participation signal rather than a synthesized "score."

VoiceTest.status moves straight to RESULTS_READY, collapsing the
COMPLETED/RESULTS_PROCESSING steps the model's docstring describes as
"never collapsed" - defensible only because there is currently no real
async grading step to occupy that gap; revisit once real grading needs
one. `completed_count` increments once per distinct student (idempotent on
replay, e.g. a client reconnect near the end of the same session) - a
correction to a UI-visible number that was silently stuck at 0 for every
Voice Test ever created, matching `assigned_count`'s separately-tracked
issue (never populated at test-creation time - out of scope here, since
fixing it means resolving WHOLE_CLASS/SPECIFIC_STUDENTS target membership
into a real count, a distinct piece of work).
