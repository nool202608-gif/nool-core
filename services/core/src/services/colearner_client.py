"""WebSocket client for the colearner service (services/colearner) - the
real voice-conversation pipeline behind the AI Assessor's WS stream (see
src/api/routes/ai_assessor.py's stream_session). Mirrors kg_client.py's
role (the one module that talks to an external nool-core service) but over
a WebSocket instead of HTTP request/response, since a colearner session is
a live, stateful, bidirectional conversation, not one call-and-response.

Auth: colearner requires a real Firebase-verified caller on its own WS (see
services/colearner/src/api/deps.py) - Core forwards the exact ID token the
browser/app already sent it on Core's own stream, rather than inventing a
separate service-to-service credential. colearner sees this as "the
student's own session," which is what it is.
